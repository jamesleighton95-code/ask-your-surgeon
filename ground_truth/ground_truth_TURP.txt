⚡ TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) — Possible Risks

Temporary mild burning, bleeding, or frequent urination
→ Very common. Happens in almost all patients.

Retrograde ejaculation (no semen comes out, as it passes into the bladder instead)
→ Very common. Affects 2 in 3 to 3 in 4 patients (65–75%).
Erections are not affected.

Symptoms not fully relieved
→ Common. Affects 1 in 2 to 1 in 10 patients (10–50%).

Erection problems (in men with previously normal erections)
→ Affects 1 in 10 to 1 in 50 patients (2–10%).

Significant bleeding requiring transfusion or re-operation
→ Affects 1 in 10 to 1 in 50 patients (2–10%).

Need for repeat treatment (if prostate grows back over time)
→ Affects 1 in 10 to 1 in 50 patients (2–10%).

Injury to the urethra causing delayed scar tissue (stricture)
→ Affects 1 in 10 to 1 in 50 patients (2–10%).

Difficulty passing urine after surgery (may need catheter or intermittent self-catheterisation)
→ Affects 1 in 10 to 1 in 50 patients (2–10%).

Loss of urinary control (incontinence) — may be temporary or permanent
→ Affects 1 in 10 to 1 in 50 patients (2–10%).

Unexpected prostate cancer found in removed tissue (may need further treatment)
→ Affects 1 in 10 to 1 in 50 patients (2–10%).

Absorption of irrigating fluid into the bloodstream (TUR syndrome — can cause confusion or heart problems)
→ Rare. Affects 1 in 50 to 1 in 250 patients (0.4–2%).

Anaesthetic or heart/lung complications (such as chest infection, blood clot, stroke, heart attack, or — very rarely — death)
→ Affects 1 in 50 to 1 in 250 patients (0.4–2%).
