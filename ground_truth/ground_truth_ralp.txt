🤖 Robotic Prostatectomy — Possible Risks

No semen during orgasm (retrograde ejaculation / dry climax)
→ Happens in all patients.
This makes you infertile, but does not affect the feeling of orgasm.

Erectile dysfunction (impotence) if nerve-sparing is not possible or nerves are damaged, sometimes with slight shortening of the penis
→ Happens in 80–85% of patients after catheter removal.

Mild urinary incontinence (leakage needing safety pads, usually not requiring surgery)
→ Affects 1 in 5 to 1 in 10 patients (10–20%).

Severe urinary incontinence (temporary or persistent leakage, may need further surgery such as an artificial sphincter or sling)
→ Affects 1 in 20 to 1 in 33 patients (3–5%).

Cancer cells found at or outside the prostate margin (positive margins on pathology)
→ Affects 1 in 10 to 1 in 50 patients (2–10%).
May require observation or further treatment.

Further treatment (hormones, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy) if PSA blood test shows cancer remains
→ Affects 1 in 10 to 1 in 50 patients (2–10%).

Urine leakage from the new join between bladder and urethra (anastomotic leak), delaying discharge or needing longer catheter use
→ Affects 1 in 10 to 1 in 50 patients (2–10%).

Bleeding requiring a transfusion or further surgery
→ Affects 1 in 10 to 1 in 50 patients (2–10%).

Pain, infection, or hernia at the small port incisions
→ Affects 1 in 10 to 1 in 50 patients (2–10%).

Lymph fluid collection (if pelvic lymph nodes are removed/biopsied)
→ Affects 1 in 10 to 1 in 50 patients (2–10%).

Anaesthetic or heart/lung problems (e.g. chest infection, blood clot, stroke, heart attack, or need for intensive care)
→ Affects 1 in 50 to 1 in 250 patients (0.4–2%).

Conversion to open surgery due to difficulty or complications
→ Happens in 1 in 100 patients (1%).

Eye problems, numbness, or weakness from nerve compression due to “head-down” position during surgery
→ Affects 1 in 50 to 1 in 250 patients (0.4–2%).

Injury to the bowel (recognised or unrecognised) that may require a temporary colostomy
→ Affects 1 in 200 to 1 in 250 patients (0.4–0.5%).
